# AprilWorkshop
The DOIMeetingSummary.pdf file is a summary of the April meeting.
## Next Steps
We now want to circulate this document in order to get more data hosting organizations to sign onto the initiative. 
'Signing onto' the initiative implies: 
1) Agreeing with the idea of issuing 'Project (collection)' and 'Series' level DOIs,
2) Working with the consortium to federate these identifiers, and
3) Work with the consortium to develop, implement and use community-wide standard services designed around these identifiers

## Who is with us (alphabetically)?
- COINS
- INCF
- LORIS
- NDA
- NITRC (and the NITRC-IR)
- TCIA
- XNAT (including DPUK, HCP, etc.)
- and You!
